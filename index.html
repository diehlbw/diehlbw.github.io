          To be more consistent in distributing puzzles (and to learn how to do some basic webpage design) many puzzles will start to be web based. This site will likely be the main hub for the puzzle I get inspired to create, until we need some other medium or capabilities.
          Please provide feedback to help me focus and improve.  I'm sure the difficulty of puzzles will be pretty inconsistent for a while, and the way they are being presented is obviously changing and so can be polished as well. Ideas for future themes is also most welcome.

          Remember, these are meant to be fun first and provide holiday points second.  Hints will be provided on request (though if from Danna or I give them out, they will cost some points...) otherwise, helping and asking for help is at your discretion. Progress will be rewarded too.

          Solutions, for the time-being, should still be by text.
