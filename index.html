            To be more consistent in distributing puzzles (and to learn how to do some basic webpage design) my new puzzles will start to be web based. This site will likely be the main hub for the puzzles I get inspired to create, until we need some other medium or capabilities.
          </p><p>
            Please provide feedback to help me focus and improve.  I'm sure the difficulty of puzzles will be pretty inconsistent for a while, and the way they are being presented is obviously changing and so can be polished as well. 
            <br />Ideas for future themes is also most welcome.
          </p><p>
            Remember, these are meant to be fun first and provide holiday points second.  Hints will be provided on request. If Danna or I give them out, they will reduce the points earned... otherwise giving and receiving help is at your discretion. 
            <br /> 
            <br /> Puzzles will likely be multiple parts, multiple layers, and may be grouped together.  If I can think of other methods to interconnect them, I'll likely do that too.  Because of this, there may be things that are not used in the part of the puzzle where they are revealed. 
            However, once a puzzle is linked to from this page it <em>is</em> intended to be solvable.
          </p><p>
            Solutions, for the time-being, should still be by text. Intermediate steps can be checked/submitted (at no penalty) and progress will be rewarded as well as final solutions.
